A solver for the "IQ Tester" puzzle.

This solver features the following command line options:

Initial empty position with '-start x' (default 0)
    This option specifies which peg should be left empty in the setup. Pegs positions are specified left to right by each row and zero-indexed. The very top peg is 0, then the next row is 1 and 2.

Board size with '-size X' (default 5)
    The normal board has sides of length 5, but this can be made arbitrarily large (with sufficient memory).

Target number of pegs remaining with '-target X' (default 1). 
    This can be theoretically any number from 1 to the max number of pegs on your specified board size.


TODO:
    - Simple web interface
    - Caching of board positions so larger sizes are feasible
